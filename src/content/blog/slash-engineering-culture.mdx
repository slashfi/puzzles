At Slash, we've built a team that delivers exceptional value. Each engineer on our team contributes millions in ARR individually. This level of impact isn't accidental — it comes from our deliberate approach to hiring, our focus on meaningful work, and our commitment to excellence in everything we do.

Success isn’t measured by headcount, lines of code shipped, or PRs merged. Instead, we focus relentlessly on outcomes and value creation.

We take individual ownership to the extreme. Engineers at Slash take the time to deeply understand our business and learn how to prioritize the work that truly matters. They adapt quickly to new feedback and information and are solely responsible for the success of the product they ship.

## A Passion for Craft

At our core, we're builders. Our DNA is defined by a genuine love for creating elegant solutions to complex problems. We get excited about new TypeScript releases, we take pride in building our own abstractions and tools to help us be more efficient, and we think about writing code as much as an art as it is engineering.

There's a special satisfaction we find in designing systems that evolves gracefully over time. We think deeply about architecture, understanding that the decisions we make today shapes our ability to ship tomorrow.

## Building at Scale

Our product powers billions of dollars in transactions every year. Working at Slash means your code doesn't just get deployed—it handles meaningful workloads that thousands of businesses depend on every second.

We've rejected the idea that you can only move fast or build things right. Our culture is centered on the belief that thoughtful, well-crafted code actually enable us to move faster over time. We take joy in figuring out how to build and iterate on systems that stay robust while allowing us to ship quickly.

## Join Us

We're looking for engineers who see coding as more than just a job. You didn't fall into programming because it pays well; you've been building and creating with code for years because you genuinely love the craft.

At Slash, you'll find yourself among similarly minded people—builders who share your passion, your drive, and your desire to create something extraordinary. Today, we're launching Puzzles, our engineering blog where we'll also be posting challenges that we find interesting. If you're a builder and want to work with us, send us over a solution to one of these puzzles and let's chat!
