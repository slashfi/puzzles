At Slash, we’re powering billions of dollars of spend annually. Having grown over 1000% during the past 12 months, we’re constantly solving new problems at increasing scale. As the amount of data grew and our system became more complex, assumptions we made about data relationships would often break. We encountered issues from multiple sources: bad backfills, bugs in production code, and small mistakes during data migrations. Over time, it became increasingly hard to verify the correctness of our data which led us to build what we now call Health Checks — a system designed to continuously verify data correctness in production.

Health checks are a tool to help us verify invariants in our codebase. When we build systems, we always design them with a set of implicit and explicit invariants, which are rules / assumptions that we expect to always hold true so that we can build more complex systems on top of them. 

> One trivial example of an invariant: in the `Card` table in our DB, where each row represents a credit card, there is a `status` column where one of the values can be “closed” and a `closedReason` column that is NULLABLE. One invariant is that the `status` column is “closed” **if and only if** the `closedReason` field is NOT NULL.

The example above isn't necessarily a condition for which we'd write a health check, but is an example of an invariant that we ensure holds true while working with this area of the codebase.

### Our initial health check design

Our first iteration of health checks looked something like this below:

```typescript
/**
 * This health check ensures that for every declined AuthorizationSet, there are no transfer intents
 */
export const hcrForDeclinedAuthSets = createHealthCheckRoutineDefinition({
  programmaticName: 'chargeCard.authSets.declinedAuthSets',
  title: 'Charge card declined auth sets',
  description:
    'This health check ensures for every declined AuthorizationSet, there are no transfer intents',
  schedule: {
    type: 'interval',
    interval: 'minutes',
    frequency: 30,
  },
})
  .bulkCheckFn((deps: DefineDependencies<[HealthCheckModule.Service]>) => {
    return async (
      cursor:
        | HealthCheckRoutineCursor<{
            authorizationSetId: string;
          }>
        | undefined
    ) => {
	    // getErrorAccounts -> a query to Snowflake
      const errorAccounts = await getErrorAccounts(cursor, deps);

      return {
        data: errorAccounts.data.map((val) => ({
          key: val.authorizationSetId,
        })),
        nextCursor: errorAccounts.nextCursor,
      };
    };
  })
  .singleCheckFn(() => async (params) => {
    const singleCheckRes = await runQuery(
      sql`...`
    );

    return {
      success: singleCheckRes.length === 0,
    };
  });
```

We initially designed health checks to be defined by SQL queries. We would run a SQL query against a table to find any “potential errors”. But because running SQL queries against large tables is expensive, we would run these checks against an eventually consistent read replica (in our case, this was Snowflake). For each result returned from the query, we would then run a check against our main production database to ensure it wasn't a false positive. This design had a few issues:

1. We had to maintain two queries. The first query would run against the read replica for the whole table. Maintainers would also have to explicitly think about and deal with pagination for the query. The second query would run against production for each individual result the first query would return.
2. Queries against the entire table would become increasingly complex and unreadable / hard to maintain since we’d be trying to encode a bunch of business logic into a single SQL query.

### Second iteration of health checks

We decided:

1. Health checks should always be run against our primary production database. Otherwise, we might not catch every issue that actually happens. 
2. Performing “full table scans” in a SQL query is a big no, but performing a controlled “full table scan” by iterating over each row and performing a health check is actually fine — as long as load is constant, predictable, and doesn’t spike, things tend to be okay.
3. Performing an iteration over time on tables in production (and abstracting that away for the developer) simplifies our DX a ton:
    1. We no longer need to maintain two complex sql queries with pagination. We only need to define the application logic for checking the health of a single item.
    2. Every health check is defined over an entire table (in the future, we may choose to extend health checks so that it can iterate specifically over an index definition).

One big learning we’ve had as a team over time is that predictable systems that exert constant load are ideal. The biggest culprit to production issues has typically been sudden unpredictable changes such as a large spike in DB load, or a sudden change in a database internal query planner.

The counterintuitive aspect about putting constant load on systems, especially with respect to databases and queues, is that it can seem wasteful. I used to believe it was better to put no load on systems by default and only do work the few times a day when needed. However, this can lead to spiky workloads that would sometimes degrade our system unexpectedly. In actuality, we've found it's usually better for there to be a small constant load running against the DB over a long period of time, even if the constant load contributes something like 1-5% usage to the overall CPU 24/7. When load is predictable, it’s easy to monitor usage rates across the board. This predictability allows us to scale horizontally with confidence and plan ahead for potential future performance issues.

There's an insightful read about this by the team at AWS: [Reliability, constant work, and a good cup of coffee](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/reliability-and-constant-work/) 

The second version of health checks now looks like:

```typescript
export const savingsAccount = createHealthCheckGroup({
  over: SlashAccountGroup,
  name: 'savings_account_interest_entities',
  schedules: {
    full_scan: {
      type: 'full_scan',
      config: {},
      props: {
        numberOfItemsToPaginate: 2000,
        minimumIntervalSinceStartOfLastRun: 3 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
      },
    },
  },
  checks: {
    interest_limit_rule_should_exist: {
      async check(group, ctx) {
        if (group.groupType === 'savings') {
          const activeInterestLimits = await from(SlashAccountGroupLimitRule)
            .leftJoin(LimitRule, {
              on: (_) => _.lr.id.equals(_.slr.limitRuleId),
            })
            .where((_) =>
              _.slr.slashAccountGroupId
                .equals(group.id)
                .and(_.slr.isActive.equals(true))
                .and(_.lr.type.equals('interest'))
            );

          ctx.shouldHaveLengthOf(activeInterestLimits, 1, {
            message:
              'Savings accounts should have exactly one active interest limit',
          });
        }
      },
    },
    // other checks
    ...
  }
});
```

With this design, it becomes very easy to add new health checks onto a single entity since each health check is defined as an asynchronous single function. We could have these health checks iterating over entire tables multiple times a day without needing to make a tradeoff between frequency since the load is constant. For the health check above, each entity performs a fast lookup to the `LimitRule` table. These checks run continuously, putting minimal but constant load on the database at any given point in time.

How this system actually runs under the hood can be simplified to roughly the following design:
1. We run our checks on top of Temporal so that we guarantee eventual execution. We use Temporal's "schedules" product to ensure that we run our cron every minute.
2. Each minute, we look at all the checks that should be scheduled NOW, and run those checks in a task queue. We throttle our task queue accordingly so that there is never more than a certain RPS being sent to our database.
3. Each activity that runs performs some sort of "constant" work. No O(N) or other time complexity that grows relative to the total number of entities in the database. This ensures that activities perform quickly, are easy to predict, and will not block the task queue itself. 

### What’s next

Health checks today form an important basis in our testing pipeline. It’s the foundation for our ongoing production verification tests. As we’ve grown, more and more general testing has been required to keep our product stable and functional. It took us several tries to get this right. We've wanted to implement some form of ledger testing / data verification in production for the past three years. However, it wasn’t until a year and a half ago when we finally built something out. Overall, some important lessons we’ve learned are:

1. Ship something, anything, and iterate on it over time. We couldn’t have reached the second iteration of our health checks without having shipped the first one.
2. Keep it simple — we want to make it as easy as possible for engineers to build and maintain health checks. Complex business logic embedded in multiple SQL queries is never fun to work with.
3. Run our checks directly on production — that’s our source of truth, and if we're running things against something else, it’ll inherently be more complex and more susceptible to false positives / negatives.

Today, health checks are the first step we've taken to better test and verify our systems outside of more traditional testing and observability. As we continue to grow, we'll introduce new forms of production verification over time as needed.
